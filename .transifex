# This is a branch-specific Transifex mapping file. It needs to be saved as
# ".transifex" in the top-level directory of each branch.
#
# A Transifex mapping file maps files in repositories to resources in Transifex
# projects.
#
# A mapping file for branches looks like this:
#
#     project transifex_project_slug_here
#
#     file relative_path_in_repo_here
#         resource    transifex_resource_name_here
#         lang        transifex_language_here
#         format      local_format remote_format
#         base        source_language_path
#
# The "project" key is always mandatory.
#
# There can be multiple (or no) file definitions.
# I call these definitions "file" sections. Each section
# continues until a new "file" section begins.
#
# For files, all keys are mandatory except for the "base" key,
# which is only needed when converting from/to _some_ formats like
# property files (but that may change, so just treat this key as reserved
# for now. Don't use it yet. It will either be used or removed when
# property files are properly supported.). For those formats, it specifies
# the relative location (in the Git repository) of a property file containing source
# language strings so that keys in the converted file can be replaced with
# proper e. g. English strings instead of cryptic keys.
#
# The "format" key is special: If only one value is specified, no
# conversion is to be done; this is the same as specifying identical
# local and remote formats and only intended as syntactical sugar.
#
# There is no special string parsing. All strings are unquoted; the value of a key
# is everything on the line after the key, with trailing and leading whitespace
# stripped.
#
# The only exception is the "format" key: Its values cannot contain any whitespace.
#
# All lines beginning with a hash character (#), preceded by optional whitespace,
# are treated as comments and ignored.
