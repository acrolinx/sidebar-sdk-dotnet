# Acrolinx Sidebar .NET SDK

This is a library for integrating the [Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/) Sidebar into a .NET application.

You can use the [Acrolinx Sidebar .NET SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acrolinx.Sidebar/)
to integrate Acrolinx in your .NET application.

It supports both .NET (8.0.0 and above) and .NET Framework (4.7.2 and above).

## The Acrolinx Sidebar

The Acrolinx Sidebar is designed to show up beside the window where you edit your content.
You use it for checking, reviewing, and correcting your content.
To get an impression what the Sidebar looks like in existing integrations, have a look at
[Sidebar Quick Start](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10252588984594-Sidebar-Quick-Start).

## Prerequisites

Please contact [Acrolinx SDK support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/sdk-support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
This sample works with a test license on an internal Acrolinx URL.
This license is only meant for demonstration and developing purposes.
Once you finished your integration, you'll have to get a license for your integration from Acrolinx.
  
Acrolinx offers different other SDKs, and examples for developing integrations.

Before you start developing your own integration, you might benefit from looking into:

* [Build With Acrolinx](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/categories/10209837818770-Build-With-Acrolinx),
* the [Guidance for the Development of Acrolinx Integrations](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance),
* the [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk), and
* the [Acrolinx Demo Projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

## Requirements

This SDK leverages Microsoft WebView2, built on Microsoft Edge Chromium, to render the Sidebar. Starting with Windows 11, Microsoft includes the Evergreen WebView2 Runtime by default.

For earlier versions of Windows, please install the WebView2 Evergreen Runtime manually.

You can download and install the Evergreen Standalone [Installer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) from Microsoft's official site.

## Getting Started

### Build Locally

1. Make sure that you have installed Microsoft Visual Studio with C# support version 2022 or later.
2. Since the Acrolinx Sidebar performs static code analysis to improve quality,
   you also have to install [Code Contracts for .NET](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970).
3. Open the solution file [`Acrolinx.Sidebar.Net.sln`](Acrolinx.Sidebar.Net.sln) with Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution.

Visual Studio downloads the required dependencies and compiles the Acrolinx .NET Sidebar Demo solution using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

*Note: The dependency download may fail on the first build. This problem can usually be solved by building a second time.*

### Releasing

1. Increment version number in [AssemblyInfo.cs](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/Acrolinx.Sidebar/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs) file.
2. Commit and push your changes to `main` branch
3. Create a tag with the same version number.
4. GitHub Action will run and publish the new version to nuget.org

### Using the SDK

Have a look at the sample source code provided in the [Acrolinx Sidebar .NET Demo](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-sidebar-demo-dotnet).
Use the [Acrolinx Sidebar .NET SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acrolinx.Sidebar/).

## SDK Features

1. **Document Model** - Provides [lookup](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/text-lookup.md)
   functionality.
2. **Start page** - Provides an interactive way to sign in to Acrolinx with built-in error handling.
3. **Logger** - Provides [logging](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/Acrolinx.Sidebar/Util/Logging/Logger.cs)
   using Log4net.
4. **Acrolinx Storage**: Applications using the Internet Explorer web browser control may be denied to access LocalStorage.
   The SDK uses its own [storage](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/Acrolinx.Sidebar/Storage/RegistryAcrolinxStorage.cs)
   mechanism using the Windows registry:
   + **Registry path**: `HKCU\Software\Acrolinx\Plugins\Storage\[KEY]`
   + **Fallback path**: `HKLM\Software\Acrolinx\Plugins\Storage\[KEY]`

### Deprecation

> :warning: **Sidebar v14 is getting deprecated**

The process to update your existing integration is straightforward and involves the following steps:

1. Update to the Latest SDK Version: Please ensure that youâ€™ve updated to the latest SDK version.
The most recent version can be found on our Nuget package page [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acrolinx.Sidebar).

1. Remove the Initialization Config (Optional): If your current implementation includes the initialization config
`MinimumSidebarVersion=14.x.x`, we recommend removing this configuration.
