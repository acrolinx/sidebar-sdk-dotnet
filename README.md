# Acrolinx Sidebar .NET SDK

Acrolinx sidebar .NET SDK code which integrator uses into a .NET application

## Prerequisites

Please contact Acrolinx SDK support (sdk-support@acrolinx.com) for initial consulting. 
We like to schedule a kickoff meeting to answer any questions about your integration project. 
After the meeting, we provide you with test server credentials and configuration settings you need to get started.

## How to Start

First make sure that you have installed at least Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 with C# support.

As the Acrolinx Sidebar performs static code analysis to improve quality, you also have to install Code Contracts for .NET:

Open the solution file `Acrolinx.Sidebar.Net.sln` with Visual Studio.

Run the solution.
 
Visual Studio downloads the required dependencies and compiles the Acrolinx .NET Sidebar solution using nuget (https://www.nuget.org/).
(Note: The dependency download may fail the on the first build. This problem can usually be solved by building a second time.)

## How to Use the Sidebar in Your Integration

Refer https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-sidebar-demo-dotnet/blob/master/README.md

## Server Dependency

To use the Acrolinx Sidebar, you need to connect to an Acrolinx server. If you've already received your Acrolinx server address, you're good to go. If your company has installed an Acrolinx server, but you don't have an address yet, ask your server administrator first.
